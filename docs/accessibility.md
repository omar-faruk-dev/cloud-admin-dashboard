# Accessibility Notes (WCAG)

- Semantic landmarks (`nav`, `main`, form labels) included in shell and auth views.
- Keyboard navigation supported via native interactive controls.
- Color contrast and focus indicators should be validated using axe/lighthouse before production.
- Screen-reader text for chart data should be added as metrics UI evolves.
